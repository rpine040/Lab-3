# Lab-3

***PLEASE NOTE***

I was unable to push due to wifi and git bash related problems.
I also had to go into my systems bios to enable VT-x so that I could test it. 
This wasn't in the instructions and I've never gone into system bios so I took time to make sure I did it correctly.
I apologize for the late push.

I have pushed this file now too in a different push because I was trying to just push the lab at all.

The repo should contain a functioning calculator.

Thank you
